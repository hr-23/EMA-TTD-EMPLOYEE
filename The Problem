● Tirumala Tirupathi , the second richest temple in the world and the only temple that gets maximum number of devotees every single day . During important days and special occasions the count reaches to 100,000 devotees visiting in a single day . This puts a huge pressure on the administration .
● Tirumala Tirupathi trip is a dream for many people in the states of Andhra . Telangana , Maharashtra , Karnataka and Tamil Nadu . Most of the families try to visit this temple at least once a year. People save money every month to visit this temple. For most of the middle class families this trip is everything .
● This trip is not an easy one to do , you will have to plan like months ahead to get the bookings done.
● With large number of people visiting the holy town , the need for efficient guide is lacking .
● Though the information is available online , most people find it hard to understand in the local languages and also there is no
clear information that answers the doubts of the pilgrims
● For example i can find the details of online bookings , but there is no details on how to book rooms offline or about the current
rush at the temple or the bus timings , routes , and real time information such as current rush in the temple queue , waiting
period ,etc .
● Pilgrims are getting trapped into scams due to lack of awareness and knowledge during this process .
● Despite the information is made online , there is a widespread confusion that i had noticed and people are basically lost and
require help and support desperately
● The TTD’s helpline numbers are most of the time busy
