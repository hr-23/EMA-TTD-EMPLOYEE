To measure the success of EMA, we can use a combination of quantitative and qualitative metrics. Here are the key performance indicators (KPIs) and methods to evaluate EMA's effectiveness:
1. User Engagement Metrics:
○ Active Users: Track the number of unique users interacting with EMA.
○ Session Duration: Measure the average time users spend interacting with EMA.
○ Interaction Frequency: Count the number of interactions per user session.
2. Response Accuracy and Effectiveness:
○ Accuracy Rate: Calculate the percentage of correct and helpful responses provided by EMA.
○ Resolution Rate: Measure the percentage of queries resolved successfully without needing human intervention.
○ Follow-Up Queries: Track the number of follow-up questions, which can indicate areas where the initial response was unclear
or insufficient.
3. User Satisfaction:
○ Feedback Scores: Collect user ratings and feedback after each interaction.
○ Net Promoter Score (NPS): Measure users' willingness to recommend EMA to others.
○ Surveys and Polls: Conduct periodic surveys to gauge overall user satisfaction and gather suggestions for improvement.
4. Operational Efficiency:
○ Call Deflection Rate: Measure the reduction in calls to TTD helplines as a result of EMA's assistance.
○ Cost Savings: Calculate the reduction in operational costs due to decreased dependency on human staff for handling common
queries.
5. Scam Reduction:
○ Reported Incidents: Track the number of reported scam incidents before and after EMA's implementation.
○ User Awareness: Measure the increase in user awareness about scams through periodic quizzes or feedback.
