How will you test your persona and validate your hypotheses quickly?
To test the EMA persona and validate the hypotheses quickly, we can use a combination of rapid prototyping, synthetic data generation, and user feedback loops. Here’s a step-by-step plan to achieve this.
Rapid Prototyping
Develop a basic prototype of EMA with core functionalities:
● Real-time information delivery
● Multilingual support
● Personalized assistance
● Scam prevention and verification
● 24/7 availability

Synthetic Data Generation
Create synthetic data that simulates real-world scenarios and user interactions. This data will help test EMA's responses and ensure it can handle various queries accurately.
User Feedback Loop
Deploy the prototype to a small group of users (beta testers) to gather initial feedback and iterate on the design based on their inputs.
