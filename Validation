Testing and Validation Process
1. Internal Testing:
○ Use synthetic data to simulate various user interactions.
○ Ensure EMA handles edge cases and provides accurate, helpful responses.
2. Beta Testing:
○ Deploy EMA to a select group of real users (e.g., TTD staff, volunteers, or frequent pilgrims).
○ Collect feedback on functionality, accuracy, and user satisfaction.
3. Feedback Analysis:
○ Analyze feedback to identify common issues and areas for improvement.
○ Adjust EMA’s algorithms and data sources based on user input.
4. Iterative Improvement:
○ Continuously update and refine EMA based on ongoing feedback and new data.
○ Expand testing to a larger user base as confidence in the system grows.
5. Full Deployment:
○ Once validated through rigorous testing, roll out EMA to the general public.
○ Monitor performance and continue to gather user feedback for ongoing improvements.
